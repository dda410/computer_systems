What still needs to be done with client.c and server.c:
     1. error_handling after every function call that can return an int error code
     DONE
     2. printf_error_handling after every print to stdout.
     DONE
     3. remove stupid and useless debugging printfs()
     4. remove all unused variables that give warnings.
     DONE
     4. improve sig_int handling in order to close gracefully once CTRL-C is pressed.
     DONE
     5. comment where needs clarification.
     6. remove stupid macros in msg.h
     DONE
     7. check how not to add padding to a struct for msg.h
     8. write the report with ascii art and flow diagrams to describe implementation choices, etc...
     9. Write back -Werror flag in Makefile
